This plugin/addon needs to be uploaded to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory on your server or installed using the WordPress plugins installer.

Once the plugin/addon is installed and activated just paste the shortcode [ESPRESSO_PROMOTIONS] into a page of your website to display a list of promotions on that page.

Currently the Promotions addon requires the Event Espresso core FET-3456-spco-promotions branch in order to operate.
The FET-3456-spco-promotions branch can be found at: https://github.com/eventespresso/event-espresso-core/tree/FET-3456-spco-promotions
Once it is released, it will function with whatever the latest core version of Event Espresso is at that time.
